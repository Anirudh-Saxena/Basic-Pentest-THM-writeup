# Pen Testing Writeup

In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

- Brute forcing 
- Hash cracking 
- Service enumeration
- Linux Enumeration

Lets get started with the task turn on the target machine and obtain the ip address of it and follow up to the browser and type the following command...


      http://<yourip>


The page will look something like ..

![page](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/01e00523-86b2-41fe-a036-ab3445d5f0e2)

**Q. Find the services exposed by the machine**

For this we will use the nmap to see what are the serivces that are open..
![nmapresult](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/4f156810-dac1-4ef2-ae6e-e2b4080f5c93)


**Q. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?**

For this we will be using gobuster tool..  

The command will be as follows:


    gobuster dir -u http://<targetip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3

The result will look like this i have terminated the result cause i have the answer from the scan tha answer is `development`

**Q. User brute-forcing to find the username & password**

Before doing this lets head to the webiste by adding `/development` in it and lets see what it has for us..
![dev](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/f67decb7-6f9a-43ce-9145-efa97296b9fe)


Okie so we have two files with some incomplete name i guess lets open them and the content of it

![devtxt](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/067f4c53-9d82-424c-9180-441df22a04ff)

![jtxt](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/20312774-de5e-4fd2-ad7f-488400b30acc)


The j.txt looks intresting it mentions some /etc/shadow stuff after searching for a bit about it, and seeing the nmap result in which the SMB port is open, so ther's
a pre isntalled tool in kali named enum4linux, so lets use this and get the username


        enum4linux -a <targetip>

The output from the scan says that the the names are `jan and kay`

**Q. What is the password?**

Now in order to find out the password we will use the hydra to bruteforce the website and get the password of the user `jan`

The command will be :

      hydra -t 4 -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<targetip>

![pass](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/e720e369-9e08-4349-b269-4c7097150e80)

      armando
    
- Note: **If you are using the wordlists for the first time then you have to decrypt the rockyou file by using this simple command `gzip -d rockyou.tz.gz` the file name can varry..**


**Q. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?**

Ans : SSH


**Now lets try to connect to server using `ssh`**


      ssh jan@<targetip>


![Screenshot_2023-08-12_14_13_54](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/84a81bf9-9775-472e-b4e7-d97d37910d7f)

Welll its clear that it doesnt contain anything, like ls give no result lets see what are the other things that we can explore..

Lets explore more and see what are the other directories that we can access or can explore..

After exploring the server we found that in order to access the kay files we need to connect as a root with it,
so lets look into the .ssh directory 

![Screenshot_2023-08-12_14_24_14](https://github.com/Anirudh-Saxena/Basic-Pentest-THM-writeup/assets/73027020/b417a433-0681-43b8-a496-7aed603eba75)



BINGO!! we found the `id_rsa` file now we can use this key to conenct with the server as **Kay** and get root access 
lets connect with the server as KAY


first lets copy the key and save the file in the local directory..

For this i will be creating a file with name idrsa

      touch idrsa

Now will access and edit the file and save the key init so tha we can use it to connect with the server as **Kay**

But first we have to decrypt the passkey for that we will be using JOHNripper bhai..

THe commands will be like this:

      sudo john idrsa.hash -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

SO the password is clear for **Kay** is `beeswax`

After getting this access now lets move forward and try to connect proccced with the last and final steps..

Now lets make the connection using jan to kay.

Command:

      ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa kay@<targetip>

**Q.  What is the final password you obtain?**
